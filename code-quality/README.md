## Requirements

- **At least one LSP plugin** — Required for `/lsp-navigation` (pyright-uvx, vtsls-npx, gopls-go, etc.).
- **Context7 MCP** — Required for `/file-audit` library validation (deprecated APIs, wrong signatures).
- **Serena MCP** — Optional. Enhances `/incremental-planning` Phase 1 with `get_symbols_overview`.
- **Sequential-Thinking MCP** — Optional. Used in `/incremental-planning` and `/roadmap` for scope boundary reasoning.
- **claude-mem MCP** — Optional. Searches past work and decisions in `/incremental-planning` Phase 1.
- **Serena reflection tools** — Optional. Enables `/reflect` skill's metacognitive checkpoints (`think_about_task_adherence`, etc.). Enable via `included_optional_tools` in `~/.serena/serena_config.yml`.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install code-quality@personal-claude-marketplace
